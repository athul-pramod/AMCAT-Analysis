**Exploratory Data Analysis of Engineering Graduates' Employment Outcomes**

**Project Overview**

This project involves a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of engineering graduates' employment outcomes, with a focus on key factors such as salary, specialization, college tier, and gender. The dataset contains information about job roles, technical skills, and demographic data, and aims to uncover insights related to career paths and salary trends.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset is sourced from the Aspiring Minds Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO) study, specifically focused on engineering graduates. It includes:

40 Features: Variables like salary, job roles, specializations, technical skills, and more.

4000 Data Points: Representing individual graduates.

**Key Objectives**

Understand salary distribution and key factors influencing salary.

Investigate the relationship between specialization and salary.

Analyze how college tier impacts salary outcomes.

Explore the relationship between gender and specialization.

Test the claim from the Times of India article on salaries for fresh graduates.

**Steps Involved**

**Data Cleaning:**

Handled missing values, standardized categorical variables, and removed outliers from salary data.

**Univariate Analysis:**

Analyzed the target variable (salary) and examined categorical and numerical variables such as specializations and technical skill scores.

**Bivariate Analysis:**

Explored how factors like job roles, specializations, and degrees relate to salary.

Investigated relationships between college tier, gender, and salary outcomes.

**Research Questions:**

Testing the Times of India Article: "Do fresh graduates in roles like Software Engineer and Programming Analyst earn INR 2.5â€“3 lakhs?"

Gender and Specialization: Is there a significant relationship between gender and specialization?

College Tier and Salary: Does the tier of a college significantly influence the starting salary?
